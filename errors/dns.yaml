Test: dns
Steps to reproduce: dig @<SERVER> +noedns +noad +norec SOA <DOMAIN>
Expected: The answer should come with the SOA record and the AA bit set (unless there is a lame delegation)
Explanation: 
Solution: Upgrade DNS server to a compliant one. 
Errors:
    timeout: The server didn't respond on time
    refused: The response came back with a REFUSED responde code
    nosoa,noaa: Response didn't return a SOA record and the AA was not set.
    servfail: Response came back with a SERVFAIL response code
    nosoa: Response didn't return a SOA record
