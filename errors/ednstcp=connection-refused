Error: ednstcp=connection-refused
Steps to reproduce: dig @<SERVER> +edns=0 +nocookie +noad +norec +dnssec +bufsize=512 +tcp DNSKEY <DOMAIN>
Expected: There should be an answer with DNSKEY record or with FORMERR. Connection failed with reason "connection refused" is forbidden.
Explanation: RFC3225, section 7.: "Responders that choose not to implement the protocol extensions defined in this document MUST respond with a return code (RCODE) of FORMERR to messages containing an OPT record in the additional section..."
Solution: Upgrade DNS server to a compliant one. Server should answer either with SOA RR or with FORMERR in case of unsupported EDNS. Also check firewall rules to not drop/block SYN packets for TCP connection to DNS server.
